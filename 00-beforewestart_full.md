# Workspace

## Where

We will be hosted for this course on the CINECA machine [PICO](http://www.cineca.it/en/news/pico-cineca-new-platform-data-analytics-applications). This machine is in [Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna) a nice city in north Italy.

As you might have already heard, the machine is organized into spaces. Let's look a little bit closer to those we will use

**$CINECA_SCRATCH**
This is where you want to keep all the big data files (e.g. `.fastq`)
Be well organized:  make a folder called `data` or  `mydata` or `projectname_data`; make sure you will be able to identify the folder the day after.

**$WORK**
This is where you want to put all the code and work on a daily base. Working in a space that is different from where the data are is useful to prevent damaging the data.


## How

Open (at least) two terminals
organize the workspace

data in $CINECA_SCRATCH
work
outerr


absolute paths


## What

become familiar with the input/output file format
this task take time and the file content is not always immediately clear, howevere teh files ar always well structured  seek for a structure

prapare input files
